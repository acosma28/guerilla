### For Extra Energy Savings add [Low-E ThermaSheet®](https://low-e.com/)

Low-E ThermaSheet® Insulated Roofing Underlayment provides a thermal break between the blazing heat of the sun and your cool air conditioned house. Low-E ThermaSheet® reduces the temperature below your roof deck which means your house uses less energy and your pockets lose less money! Low-E ThermaSheet® may be installed directly under shingles, metal roofing, etc. and is ICC approved (ESR-3652) to be used as a stand alone alternative to felt paper and other traditional underlayments that do nothing to protect your home from heat gain/loss. Isn’t it time your roofing underlayment did more? Now it can, with Low-E ThermaSheet®. Do more, with less. Save energy. Save money. Period.
