At Sunrise Construction, we pride ourselves on understanding the unique needs of our clients, especially in the distinct coastal environment of the Outer Banks. This region presents specific challenges, from high winds to salty air, and our Salt Box roofing system is designed to meet these challenges head-on. Here’s why we offer this specialized package and the meticulous procedure we follow to ensure a durable and reliable installation.

#### Understanding the Outer Banks Environment

The Outer Banks is renowned for its stunning coastal beauty, but it also brings its fair share of harsh weather conditions. High winds, salt-laden air, and heavy rains can take a toll on residential roofs. Homeowners here need a roofing system that can withstand these elements while remaining cost-effective. That’s where our Salt Box roofing system comes in.

#### The Salt Box Roofing System: Strong, Dependable, and Budget-Friendly

The Salt Box system is our base-tier offering, designed specifically for A-framed roofs ranging from 1900 to 2500 square feet. It combines strength, reliability, and affordability, making it an ideal choice for many homeowners in the Outer Banks.

**Key Features of the Salt Box System:**

- **Tamko Heritage Architectural Shingles:** These shingles offer a wood-shake look and beauty, with a fiberglass mat construction and a self-sealing strip of asphalt. They come with a limited lifetime warranty, a 10-year Full Start® non-prorated warranty period, and a 10-year algae cleaning limited warranty.
- **Tamko Starter and Ridge Cap:** Essential components for a robust roofing system, providing additional layers of protection.
- **Ice & Water Shield:** Installed in vulnerable areas such as eaves, rake edges, overhangs, and valleys, this shield is crucial for preventing water infiltration caused by wind-driven rain.
- **ABC Synthetic Underlayment:** Slip-resistant, durable, and resistant to UV rays and moisture, this underlayment ensures the roof remains protected even if a shingle is lost during a storm.
- **Stainless Steel Roof Nails:** These nails offer superior corrosion resistance, ideal for the salty air of coastal climates.
- **Composite Vents and Pipe Collars:** Durable and reliable components that contribute to the overall strength of the roofing system.
- **F8 Drip Edge:** Directs water away from the fascia, preventing water damage and protecting the roof from wind-driven rain.

#### Our Installation Procedure

At Sunrise Construction, we follow a meticulous procedure to ensure each Salt Box roofing system is installed to the highest standards.

**1. Inspection and Preparation**
- We begin with a thorough inspection of the existing roof structure to identify any underlying issues that need to be addressed.
- The area is then prepared by removing old roofing materials and ensuring a clean, smooth surface for installation.

**2. Installing the Ice & Water Shield**
- We apply two rows of ice & water shield at the eaves and one row at the gables to protect against water infiltration in vulnerable areas.

**3. Applying the Underlayment**
- Next, we install the ABC synthetic underlayment. Its slip-resistant and durable properties ensure a secure and lasting foundation for the shingles.

**4. Placing the Drip Edge**
- The F8 drip edge is installed along the roof edges to direct water into the gutters and away from the fascia, protecting the underlying structure from water damage.

**5. Installing the Shingles**
- We then lay down the Tamko starter shingles, followed by the Heritage architectural shingles, ensuring a tight and secure fit.
- The ridge cap shingles are installed to provide additional protection and enhance the roof’s aesthetic appeal.

**6. Securing with Stainless Steel Nails**
- Throughout the process, we use stainless steel roof nails to ensure the entire roofing system is securely fastened and resistant to corrosion.

**7. Final Touches**
- Composite vents and pipe collars are installed to ensure proper ventilation and sealing around roof penetrations.

**8. Quality Check and Clean-Up**
- Once the installation is complete, we conduct a thorough quality check to ensure everything meets our high standards.
- The site is then cleaned up, leaving your property looking neat and your new roof ready to withstand the elements.
