When it comes to building homes in the Outer Banks, our company, Sunrise Construction, understands the unique challenges and requirements posed by the coastal environment. From the constant threat of high winds and water to the corrosive effects of salt and sand, constructing durable and resilient homes is our top priority. That's why we choose Wincore windows for our projects. In this blog post, we’ll explain why Wincore windows are the ideal choice for Outer Banks homes and walk you through our installation procedure.

## The Wincore Advantage
1. Superior Design and Durability
Wincore 500 Series windows are specifically designed to handle the extreme conditions of coastal areas. With their brickmold frame and integral J-channel, these windows offer a seamless fit with both brick and siding exteriors. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also significantly reduces installation time and labor costs, making them a practical choice for our projects.

2. Energy Efficiency
Wincore windows feature dual-paned glass with optional Low E glass and Argon gas fill. This combination maximizes energy efficiency by keeping homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, which is crucial for maintaining comfort and reducing energy bills in the variable climate of the Outer Banks.

3. Enhanced Protection
The windows are equipped with a U-channel spacer system that moderates outside air before it hits the inside sash, further enhancing energy efficiency. Weatherseals placed at key points around each sash help reduce air flow, providing an additional layer of protection against the elements.

4. Customization Options
Wincore offers a variety of exterior and interior colors, allowing homeowners to customize their windows to match their personal style. The availability of different grid patterns and window styles ensures that every home can have a unique and cohesive look.

## Our Installation Procedure
At Sunrise Construction, we follow a meticulous procedure to ensure that every Wincore window is installed to perfection, providing our clients with the best possible performance and longevity.

Step 1: Site Preparation
Before installation begins, we thoroughly inspect the site and prepare the window openings. This involves ensuring that the openings are level, plumb, and free of any debris or obstructions.

Step 2: Placing the Windows
We carefully place the Wincore windows into the prepared openings, ensuring a tight fit. The integral J-channel design of the Wincore windows helps us achieve a neat and tidy finish, whether the exterior is brick or siding.

Step 3: Securing and Sealing
Once the windows are in place, we secure them using the appropriate fasteners. We then apply high-quality sealants around the edges to prevent water and air infiltration. This step is crucial for maintaining the energy efficiency and durability of the windows.

Step 4: Insulation and Weatherproofing
To further enhance the energy efficiency of the windows, we add insulation around the frames. We also install weatherstripping at key points to reduce air flow and protect against the harsh coastal elements.

Step 5: Final Inspection
After installation, we conduct a thorough inspection to ensure that each window operates smoothly and meets our high standards of quality. We check for proper alignment, secure sealing, and smooth operation of all moving parts.

Step 6: Cleanup and Customer Walkthrough
We believe in leaving the job site cleaner than we found it. After the installation is complete, we clean up any debris and conduct a final walkthrough with the homeowner to ensure their complete satisfaction.
